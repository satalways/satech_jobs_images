<b>Make your recruitment process smooth and easy</b>

	<li>Perform multiple actions related to hiring and recruitment from a single platform.</li>
</ol>

<b>Post job ads in a blink of an eye</b>
<ol>
	<li>Have too many job openings? No problem! Post as many job ads as you like.</li>
	<li>Add unlimited job categories</li>
	<li>Specify job location and salary, so only relevant people apply</li>
	<li>Add an expiration date so the job ad is automatically removed from the site after the expiration date is over (date can be changed later on if needed)</li>
	<li>Make job ads active/inactive with one click</li>
	<li>Delete one or multiple job ads with one click</li>
</ol>

</p>

<b>Want your client or a colleague to receive an email every time a new application is submitted?</b>
<p>Use our cc and bcc function to email application details to your clients and colleagues.</p>

<b>Use different currency symbols on different job openings.</b>
<p>We understand that some of you will have offices across different continents and keeping that in mind we have given you the power to choose different currency symbols for different job ads.</p>

<b>Want applicants/candidates to apply for the job at a different website?</b>
<p>Sure thing. While adding a new job opening, just enter the link where the applicant should land when they click on the apply button.</p>
<p>(If the external link field is empty, then a job form will appear when an applicant clicks on the apply button)</p>

<b>Would you like your applicants to see a certain name and email address when they receive an email from you?</b>
<p>No worries! On the settings page, we have given you the option to write the name and email address which should appear when you send emails to the applicants. The plugin will then start sending emails using that name and email.</p>

<b>Don’t want to give the HR guy access to your entire site?</b>
<p>No issue at all. Add a new user and assign him the SA Job HR role. This user will only have access to the jobs plugin, not the entire site.</p>

<b>Tired of spam?</b>
<p>Choose between two captcha options (Google ReCaptcha and PHP captcha) available on our plugin to tackle this problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img src="images/captcha.jpg" alt="" class="max-w100">
</p>

<b>Managing job applications would no longer feel like a daunting task</b>
<p>All the applications will be saved in the back-end of your site. Perform numerous actions on the job applications that you have received. We have listed out the actions you can perform below.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Shortlist candidates</li>
	<li>Rate different job applications</li>
	<li>Send interview invitation email to candidates with a single click</li>
	<li>Create unlimited custom email templates</li>
	<li>Option to get an email alert when a new application is submitted</li>
	<li>Send a confirmation email to candidates when an application is submitted</li>
	<li>Option to send rejection emails with a single click</li>
	<li>Email candidates and keep a track of all the communication</li>
	<li>Once the applicant is hired, mark him/her selected</li>
</ul>

<b>Our plugin is GDPR Compliant</b>
<p>Users can automatically delete job applications after a set number of days. Just go to settings and choose how many days you’d like to keep an application saved with you. The plugin will start counting the days from the day when an application was submitted. If you don’t wish to automatically delete any application, then choose never.</p>
